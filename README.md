Setup and Dependencies:

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (openai, requests, speech_recognition, gtts, gradio). Install them using:

bash

pip install openai requests speechrecognition gtts gradio

Replace 'your_openai_api_key_here' with your actual OpenAI API key and configure any additional settings as needed. This code should serve as a solid foundation for further development and refinement.
